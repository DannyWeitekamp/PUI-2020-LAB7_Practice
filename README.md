# PUI-2020-LAB7_Practice

This lab uses react-native. To get started you should install the dependencies with:

`npm install`

And you should also install expo-cli globally with:

`npm i -g expo-cli`

To run the development server and interact with the app run:

`npm run web`

This project has 3 TODOs:

1) Use flexbox to orgainze the profile images into rows that wrap, but always fill the page
2) Emulate the :hover css pseudo selector by dynamicallly adding a style using a state hook in the Container component
3) Turn each profie container into a button by using a TouchableOpacity

A solution can be found on the solution branch:

`checkout solution`
